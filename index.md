#How to use IPS Database

IPS Database is an app for your phone or desktop that can show you all the information relating to Acotrs, Props, and House Rentals. It has 8 tabs to help you do this

##1st Tab: Actor Filter

Actor filter allows you to filter down actors into categories that you are searching for. The order of the categories is Gender, Ethnicity, Age Range, and Body Type.
Once you have finished your filter it will show you the list of actors that fall into that category arranging them in first name, last name, and age.
Click on the tab you are intersted in to get the deticated page for that actor.
You can choose `All` in any category to select every possibility **in that category**.
**Note:** if any actor has a rating of 1 it will display `Do Not Use Again` at the top of the actor page
