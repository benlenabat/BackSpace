# Common Problems

### I can't see a actors' photo that I just uploaded to the database
If you uploaded a new actor to the database it may take a while before their picture shows up, this should happen within 24 hours.

### I can't edit/submit a new actor/location/prop to the database
This is most likely because the information entered is not following the requirements. Make sure that all required fields are filled and are in the correct format.
